		<p> <strong> The digit spin test was designed to assess your working memory. </strong> A testperson is visually or auditorily exposed to a sequence of digits one after the other. Right afterwards, the test subject has to recall the correct digits in the same order. Most people manage to recap around seven digits. </p>

		<h1 class="animated slideInRight"> Introduction to our research </h1>

		<p> <parabegin> Many of the global dilemma is largely shaped by unsustainable decision-making from all levels</parabegin>, from individual consumers to probably governments. As a result, humankind is facing a multitude of environmental problems, from depletion of natural resources, unprecedented species extinction rates to emergence of non-communicable health issues. Especially in urban areas where the environmental footprints has shown to be highest, people constantly face stress and are detached from the environmental repercussions of their decisions and thus are prone to make decisions detrimental to their own well-being as well as the public good. </p>
		<p> <parabegin> A large body of research has shown association of exposure to nature and human wellbeing</parabegin>. Fleeting nature exposure in various forms: visually via viewing pictures or videos of natural landscapes,  via nature walks have shown to reduce stress and lift mood. Chronic exposure to nature, as measured by greenness level of the place where the subjects live have also been proven to associate with lower stress levels. Such positive impact can be achieved via physiological (such as dues to increased exercise) or psychological (the biophilia hypothesis). In addition to state level impacts, nature exposure can also promote cooperative decision-making and result in environmentally sustainable behaviour in a lab simulation.</p>
		<p> <parabegin> Singapore is a highly urbanized city </parabegin>, being the third densely populated country in the world  with no hinterland. As it strives to realize the “City in a garden” vision, Singapore has battled over urban development and conservation of natural landscape. Singapore suffers from many health concerns that are prevalent in any cities: obesity, high blood pressure, depression to name a few. However, research suggests that exposure to nature can mitigate such conditions. Despite massive greening movement, more than 99% country’s natural habitats have been cleared by 1990 and as a result most of the general public in Singapore have grown up with their perceptions of nature largely shaped by exposure to manicured landscapes.</p> 
		<p>	Understanding public preference for urban green space might help in designing landscape that could maximize public well-being as well as streamlining educational campaigns on environmental awareness.</p>
		<p> In this study, we aim to study the psychological impacts of nature exposure to human. You will participate in one or some of the fun games below to help us gain insights into the psychological impacts of nature exposure in Singapore.</p>

		<h3> About us </h3>
		<p> We are scientists at <a href="http://blog.nus.edu.sg/bioeconlab/" target="_blank" style="color:coral"> the BioEcon Lab</a>, Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Singapore.</p>
		<p>This research is part of the project "Green capital and human wellbeing: Enhancing the nature experience through experimental analysis of causal pathways between biodiversity and subjective wellbeing in Singapore" funded by the National Parks Board (NParks) and conducted in collaboration with the Centre for Biodiversity and Conservation Science, University of Queensland.</p>

		<p> If you would you like to take part in the game, please read the following Participant Information Sheet and provide your consent </p>
<ol>
		<li>Purpose of the study</li>
		<p>	To understand public preference for urban green space as well as psychological impacts of nature exposure in order to help in designing landscape that could maximize public well-being as well as streamlining educational campaigns on environmental awareness.</p>
		<li>Participation and withdrawal</li>
		<p>Participation in this study is completely voluntary, and you may withdraw at any time without any negative consequences or penalty. If you wish to withdraw, simply stop completing the survey. Any data that is collected up to that point will not be used in the study. </p>

		<h2 class="coolTitle"> Introduction to our research </h2>
		

		<p> <strong>Many of the global dilemma is largely shaped by unsustainable decision-making from all levels</strong>,  from individual consumers to probably governments. As a result, humankind is facing a multitude of environmental problems, from depletion of natural resources, unprecedented species extinction rates to emergence of non-communicable health issues. Especially in urban areas where the environmental footprints has shown to be highest, people constantly face stress and are detached from the environmental repercussions of their decisions and thus are prone to make decisions detrimental to their own well-being as well as the public good. </p>
		<p> <strong> A large body of research has shown association of exposure to nature and human wellbeing</strong>. Fleeting nature exposure in various forms: visually via viewing pictures or videos of natural landscapes (Van der Wal, Schade et al. 2013),  via nature walks (Hartig, Evans et al. 2003, Lee, Park et al. 2011, Van Den Berg and Custers 2011, Bratman, Daily et al. 2015) have shown to reduce stress and lift mood. Chronic exposure to nature, as measured by greenness level of the place where the subjects live have also been proven to associate with lower stress levels. Such positive impact can be achieved via physiological (such as dues to increased exercise) or psychological (the biophilia hypothesis). In addition to state level impacts, nature exposure can also promote cooperative decision-making and result in environmentally sustainable behaviour in a lab simulation (Zelenski, Dopko et al. 2015).</p>
		<p> <strong> Singapore is a highly urbanized city </strong>, being the third densely populated country in the world (The World Bank 2017) with no hinterland. As it strives to realize the “City in a garden” vision, Singapore has battled over urban development and conservation of natural landscape. Singapore suffers from many health concerns that are prevalent in any cities: obesity, high blood pressure, depression ()… However, research suggests that exposure to nature can mitigate such conditions ()… Despite massive greening movement, only 0.16% of Singapore’s land area is deemed primary forest and managed vegetation occupies over 27% of the total landmass (Yee, Corlett et al. 2011). By 1990, more than 99% country’s natural habitats have been cleared (Corlett 1992), and as a result most of the general public in Singapore have grown up with their perceptions of nature largely shaped by exposure to manicured landscapes. This probably explains public’s preference towards manicured landscapes over more natural types, such as secondary and primary forests (Khew, Yokohari et al. 2014).</p> 
		<p>	Understanding public preference for urban green space might help in designing landscape that could maximize public well-being as well as streamlining educational campaigns on environmental awareness.</p>
		<p> In this study, we aim to study the psychological impacts of nature exposure to human. You will participate in one or some of the fun games below to...</p>
